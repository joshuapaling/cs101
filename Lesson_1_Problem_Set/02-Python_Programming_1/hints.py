# Please write HINTS here

# From the README:
# We do NOT accept pull requests that have deleted another contributer's hint or solution without a very clear reason
# ONLY use concepts covered in the class so far
# Do NOT give solutions here - ONLY hints

# work out how many hours are in a day
# times that by the number of days in a week
# then times by the number of weeks
# use print to show the answer
