# Please write HINTS here

# From the README:
# We do NOT accept pull requests that have deleted another contributer's hint or solution without a very clear reason
# ONLY use concepts covered in the class so far
# Do NOT give solutions here - ONLY hints
In order to answer this question we must look at what we are trying to do. 
We are aiming to build a table given one input which is a number, and print all the possible whole number multiplication combinations available with the input number. 
So that means we want to first reiterate over the first integer and then the second integer until it hits the input number.
Printing out the table is relatively simple, it is just a matter of concatenating the numbers and the signs together using the hint given by the question.Â
